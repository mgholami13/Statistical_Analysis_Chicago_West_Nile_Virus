West Nile Virus (WNV) is a viral illness largely spread by mosquitoes. The disease is transmitted to a person when an infected mosquito bites them.

The city of Chicago, Illinois has been keeping track of mosquito populations and WNV prevalence using a series of traps that they place around the city. They are then able to study the captured specimens and monitor the state of WNV spread in the city.

The given mosquito tracking data from 2008 to 2019 is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chicago/chicago-west-nile-virus-mosquito-test-results?select=west-nile-virus-wnv-mosquito-test-results.csv.

In Part #1, I will perform basic EDA and data wrangling to get familiar with the dataset from the city of Chicago.

Part #1 includes these analysis steps:

- Data Cleaning
- Feature Engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations


In Part #2, I will move on to a set of analyses on the relationship between the different variables and the mosquito number, as well as the probability of finding West Nile Virus (WNV) at any particular time and location.
Linear regression and logistic regression as statistical methods will be used in this study. 

Part #2 is organized in the following sections:

- Basic Analysis
- Statistical Analysis
- Advanced Statistical Analysis
	* Linear regression
	* Logistic regression

- Conclusion
